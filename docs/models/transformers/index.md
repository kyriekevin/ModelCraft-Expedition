# Transformer Models

This section contains implementations and documentation for various transformer-based architectures. Transformers have revolutionized deep learning across multiple domains, particularly in natural language processing and computer vision.

## Available implementations

## Key Concepts

Transformer models share several key architectural components:

- Self-Attention Mechanism - Allows the model to weigh the importance of different tokens
- Multi-Head Attention - Enables the model to attend to information from different representation subspaces
- Position Encodings - Provides information about token position in the sequence
- Layer Normalization - Stabilizes the learning process
- Feed-Forward Networks - Processes the attention output through non-linear transformations

Common Applications

- Natural Language Processing - Text classification, machine translation, question answering
- Computer Vision - Image classification, object detection, segmentation
- Multimodal Learning - Text-to-image generation, visual question answering
