# ModelCraft Expedition

A personal repository documenting my journey implementing various AI architectures and algorithms from scratch. This collection serves as both a learning resource and reference for different model implementations.

## 📚 Implementation Philosophy

Each implementation aims to balance code clarity with performance. The focus is on understanding the underlying principles rather than optimizing for production use. Comments and documentation are prioritized to make the learning process transparent.

## 🔄 Progress Tracking

This is an ongoing project that will grow as I implement more models and refine existing implementations. Check the commit history to see the latest additions.

## 🤝 Resources & References

Each implementation directory contains a references.md file listing the papers, tutorials, and other resources that informed the implementation.
