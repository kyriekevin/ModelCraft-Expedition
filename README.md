# ModelCraft Expedition

A personal repository documenting my journey implementing various AI architectures and algorithms from scratch. This collection serves as both a learning resource and reference for different model implementations.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

ModelCraft Expedition is a learning project focused on implementing AI models and algorithms, including:

- Transformer architectures (ViT)

Each implementation includes detailed comments and documentation to facilitate learning and understanding.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

```
modelcraft-expedition/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                  # Model and component implementations
â”œâ”€â”€ notebooks/            # Usage examples and tutorials
â””â”€â”€ docs/                 # Detailed documentation and references
```

## ðŸ“š Main Modules

- [Models](./src/modelcraft_expedition/models/) - Implementations of various AI architectures

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kyriekevin/modelcraft-expedition.git
cd modelcraft-expedition

# Install dependencies
uv pip install -e .
```

## ðŸ’¡ Implementation Philosophy

Each implementation aims to balance code clarity with performance. The focus is on understanding the underlying principles rather than optimizing for production use. Comments and documentation are prioritized to make the learning process transparent.

## ðŸ”„ Progress Tracking

This is an ongoing project that will grow as I implement more models and refine existing implementations. Check the commit history to see the latest additions.
